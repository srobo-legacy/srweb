<h1>How to Enter</h1>

<p>
	If you are new to Student Robotics and would like to express interest in taking part in the competition,
	please do <a href="/about/contactus">get in contact with us</a>.
	You can also have a look at the <a href="/teams/">teams</a> that are competing this year.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>

<p>
	Student Robotics teams generally comprise about 4-6 sixth&ndash;form and college students (ages 16-18),
	plus an adult <a href="/schools/team-leaders/">team-leader</a> (usually a teacher).
	If you'd like to enter a team with a different make-up,
	please do <a href="/about/contactus">get in contact with us</a>,
	but note that the presence of a responsible adult team-leader is required.
</p>
<p>
	Typically we allocate places to teams in September, around two months before <a href="/events/kickstart">Kickstart</a>.
	If you have not recruited a team before submitting your entry, this is the point where you should start doing so.
</p>

<h2>Interested in SR{{ site.sr.year }}?</h2>
{% if site.sr.openings == false %}

<p>
	Please fill out this form if you're intending on being the <a href="/schools/team-leaders/">team leader</a>
