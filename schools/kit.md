The Kit
=======

All teams who take part in SR receive a Student Robotics kit. This kit is
designed and custom built for the competition.

The kit is modular, with sensors and a vision system to allow your robot to
observe the world, as well as motors and servos to allow it to move. These
are controlled autonomously by a python program written by the team. Our kit
lets you interact with these devices, without needing to worry about the
intermediate electronics.

Our kit is easy to use and hard to break, with good [documentation](/docs/kit)
and [support](/schools/support) available. SR provides a web based development
environment, through which you program your robot, meaning you can use any
computer with a web browser.

We also try not to limit you with what we provide: you can extend the kit in
interesting and exciting ways. You are encouraged to attach your own
electronics, whether off the shelf or homemade. We also provide teams with a
small [budget](/schools/support#Budget) to aid this.
