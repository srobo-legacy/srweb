Schools & Colleges
==================

Student Robotics runs a robotics competition for teams comprised of about 4-6
sixth&ndash;form and college students (ages 16-18) primarily from the local (Southampton, UK) area.
All teams are [supported](/schools/support) to ensure they reach their potential;
teams
that aren't too far away will get a weekly visit from one of the Student Robotics
Mentors, who will offer guidance and monitor the progress of the team.

The competition is generally arena&ndash;based and, in the past, has involved
picking up coloured blocks and throwing balls into nets. To see the scale of the operation,
 why not have a look at the time-lapse video (right) of a previous arena going up,
 the competition, and the arena coming down.

[The Kit](/schools/kit)
----------------------

Student Robotics understands how restrictive money can be for running activities
like this. To combat this issue, we've found some [sponsors](/about/sponsors) &ndash;
 to whom we are very grateful &ndash; making the kit for the teams completely
free. That's right, **free**! The only things that will need to be bought are
materials for the robot base/body and any motors, servos, etc. We provide a
[budget](/schools/support#Budget) for each team to buy these items,
 which is typically enough to cover
everything needed to make a robot. This allows you to focus on building your
awesome robot, not worrying about the cost!

Why not have a look at this year's [kit](/schools/kit)?


[The Documentation](/docs)
---------------------------------

Using the kit may seem quite daunting at first, but please bear in mind the fact
that it has been designed to be as easy to use as possible. All of the
low&ndash;level interfacing with the hardware has been done by us, leaving a nice,
higher&ndash;level way of making the robot do things. The robots are programmed
by the teams in [Python](http://www.python.org/), a language recommended for both
new and experienced programmers alike.

To see how it all works, please have a read of the [documentation](/docs/).
