[The game](#sr2015) {#sr2015}
=============================

In the 2015 game, *Capture the Flag*, teams score points by moving as many of the five flags into their scoring zone as they can.

Navigation in the arena is made more complex by barriers which exist between team's zones.

Each of the flags, which are on casters and weigh 2kg, are worth one point and may be moved by any robot.

The [full rules](/resources/2015/rulebook.pdf) contain further details of the game as well as a list of the available prizes.

[2014](#sr2014) {#sr2014}
-------------------------

The 2014 game, *Slots*, saw an interesting new dimension added to the game as the tokens had a right-way-up.

Points could be scored by:

 * righting the tokens (which started upside-down)
 * moving them into either:
    * a slot (which could hold one token)
    * a zone (with the aim of having the most tokens in a zone)

Full details about the game, the scoring method and more, remain available in the [rulebook](/resources/2014/rulebook.pdf).

[2013](#sr2013) {#sr2013}
-------------------------

The 2013 competition, *A Strange Game*, saw thirty teams build robots looking to dominate a game of noughts and crosses.
Each robot, equipped with six rather large cardboard boxes, attempted to take-over squares in a 3x3 grid in the centre of an arena.
The more squares owned in a row or column, the more points a robot would score.
For further details about the game see the [full rules](/resources/2013/rulebook.pdf).

[2012](#sr2012) {#sr2012}
-------------------------

The 2012 competition, *Pirate Plunder*, considerably increased the scope for interesting activity compared to our previous games.
Autonomous robots raced to collect cube-shaped tokens and get them back to the bucket in their home zone.
Robots could also steal each other's buckets, leading to an variety of possible tactics.
The [full rules](/resources/2012/rulebook.pdf) of the 2012 game are available for those interested.

[2011](#sr2011) {#sr2011}
-------------------------

<img src="/images/content/arena.png" alt="A diagram of the SR2011 arena" class="right" />
In 2011 the competition game involved a track-based arena with some scattered baked bean tins to pick up.
The arena can be seen in the diagram to the right.
Full details about the game played in 2011 are available in the [rules](/resources/2011/rulebook.pdf).

Further event details and the results are available from the
 [news article](/news/2011-05-04_sr2011_comp_happened) posted shortly afterwards.
