Resources for Team Leaders
==========================

Every team that competes in Student Robotics must be associated with a responsible adult.
This person is that team's **team leader**.
Most team leaders are volunteers, and their effort makes Student Robotics possible.

The team leader is responsible for the following:

 * Ensuring that all the requirements of the school, college, or organisation that the members of their team are associated with are met - for example, [risk assessments](#RiskAssessment).
 * Creating and managing [user accounts](#UserAccounts) for their team members.
 * Ensuring that all team members, and team guests attending the competition, have registered for a ticket.
See [tickets](#Tickets).

[Risk Assessment](/schools/team-leaders/#RiskAssessment) {#RiskAssessment}
-----------------

Most schools require that activities or outings they engage in with their students are risk-assessed.
In order to reduce paperwork, we provide some risk assessments that may be suitable.  The SR2014 competition risk assessment can be [downloaded here](/resources/2014/riskassessment.pdf)

[User Accounts](/schools/team-leaders/#UserAccounts) {#UserAccounts}
---------------

It is important that every team member has a Student Robotics [user account](/docs/user_accounts).
It is these accounts that allow them to access the [IDE](/ide) and the [forums](/forum), which are both vital to the operation of the team.

The signup process for these accounts is simple.  The team leader will receive an account of their own via email.  Using this account, the team leader can create and manage their team's accounts through our [user management interface](/userman).

A team leader's request for a team member's account will be processed by us.  The team member will then receive an email containing their new username and password.

[Tickets](/schools/team-leaders/#Tickets) {#Tickets}
---------

Every person attending the competition will require a ticket.
A prerequisite for receiving a ticket is that Student Robotics has received a signed media consent form for that person.
This form should be sent via mail or given to Student Robotics and once we have received it a [ticket](/tickets/ "Download your ticket now") can downloaded and printed.

The [SR2014 Media Consent Form](/resources/2014/mediaconsent.pdf) is now available for non-competing visitors. Competitors should not fill this form out: instead, sign into the [media consent page](/mediaconsent), which will serve a pre-filled consent form for easier processing.

Budget Reclaim   {#BudgetReclaim}
--------------

To reclaim your team's [budget](/schools/support#Budget) you will need to email our treasurers with the receipts for your purchases.  Send an email to [treasurer@studentrobotics.org](mailto:treasurer@studentrobotics.org) with:

 * The receipts attached (you will need to scan in any paper receipts you have)
 * The 3 or 4 letter name of your team
 * The name that we should make the cheque out to
 * The address that we should post the cheque to

You can claim your budget up to one month after the competition.
