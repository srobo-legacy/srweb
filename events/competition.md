Competition
===========

The student robotics competition is the culmination of all the teams' work on
their robots.  After months of prototyping and testing, robots from around
Europe will meet in the arena. For details about the game, the scoring method
and more, head over to [this year's competition rules](/docs/rules).

The competition itself is a mutiple day event, around the school Easter
holiday. All the teams will meet each other, introduce their robots and see
everyone else's ingenious designs. Even if you are not directly involved, you
are welcome to come and spectate.

Teams will first compete in scheduled matches in a league. The best robots will
make it in to a knockout. During all of this, teams will have the opportunity to
tinker with their robots.

At the end of the knockouts, one team will emerge victorious claiming the
trophy. Also, the team whose robot displays the most ingenuity will receive the
prestigious committee award.
