We start the Student Robotics competition with our "Kickstart" event,
an introduction to how the competition is run, and to the electronics
equipment that teams will be using to build their robots. The game that
the robots will have to play is also revealed.

Kickstart typically occurs in October of each year, in a number of locations
across the country. For full details about the date of Kickstart, and to find
where the closest to you is, please see the [key dates](/key_dates) page.

The event provides an opportunity for the teams to meet competitors from other
schools and the volunteers who run the competition, as well as ask any
questions they may have about the competition game and how to go about building
their robot. We set a series of [small challenges](/microgames) using the [kit](/schools/kit)
to get competitors building and learning immediately.

### Kit Delivery

We expect that the majority of teams will be able to collect their [kits](/schools/kit)
at Kickstart. Alternatively, you can arrange for it to be collected by
courier during the week following. Please [contact us](mailto:info@studentrobotics.org) for collection details.

If you think that you will have difficulty doing this (e.g: overseas teams),
then please let us know in advance. We are able to assist a limited number
of teams with shipping if you are unable to collect them at Kickstart.
