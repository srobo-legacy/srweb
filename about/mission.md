Mission Statement
=================

We aim to:

* Share our excitement about engineering with others
* Introduce younger people to the range of activities involved in an engineering project including:
	+ Teamwork
	+ Planning
	+ Technical Design
	+ Technical Build
	+ Testing
* Use the medium of robotics to inspire the next generation to take their involvement with engineering to the next level
* Develop our own project management and technical engineering experience by leading others

We achieve this by holding a competition between groups of students from sixth form schools and colleges. University engineering students visit the groups of students, as mentors, on a weekly basis throughout term time leading up to the competition to help the group work towards an ambitious goal.
