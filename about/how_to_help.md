How to Help
===========

Schools and Colleges
--------------------

We would love it if more schools (with sixth-forms) and colleges got involved. The [competition](/schools/game) gets better and better each year, and can only get better with more teams! Head over to the [Schools](/schools/) section to find out more. 


Southampton University Students
-------------------------------

We are always looking for university students to help. Anyone from Engineers to Graphic designers are welcome to join us and help with everything from hardware design through to media. If you are a Southampton University student and are interested or want to find out more, please [contact us](/about/contactus) or come along to our [doings](https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/wiki/doings), Wednesdays from 5pm-11pm (term time only), in Zepler Seminar Room 1 (now known as a Common Learning Space).

Bristol University Students
---------------------------

We're just getting off the ground in Bristol and actively looking to recruit more Students. Please [contact us](/about/contactus), we'd love to have you join us.

Other Universities
------------------

Do you like the sound of our project, but there isn't an SR Branch near you? Why not [get in touch](/about/contactus), and see whether we can help you can set up a new SR Branch based at your University?


Sponsors
--------

Student Robotics really could not happen if we didn't have our sponsors. And there are more ways to sponsor than giving money: you could offer bits of kit, your services (manufacturing, printing, etc...), or perhaps even your time. Visit the [Sponsors](/about/sponsors) page to find out more.
