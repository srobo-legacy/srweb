...the people who make the dream of Student Robotics a Reality
--------------------------------------------------------------

Student Robotics is a not-for-profit organisation, and so depends on
donations from its sponsors to continue its mission.  The following
organisations sponsor Student Robotics:

### [Motorola Solutions Foundation](http://responsibility.motorolasolutions.com/index.php/solutions-for-community/com02-foundation/) ###

The Motorola Solutions Foundation is the primary sponsor of Student Robotics. They have provided most of the money needed to make it all happen.


### [University of Southampton's School of Electronics and Computer Science](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) ###

<abbr title="School of Electronics and Computer Science">ECS</abbr> not
only provide us a place to meet and work, they have helped in other areas
including a lot of the design of this website.
In the summer of 2010 ECS employed two interns to work on behalf of Student Robotics,
 allowing us to develop our new website and kit.
In the summer of 2011 ECS once again employed an intern to develop the kit,
 focusing on the vision component.


### [BitBox](http://www.bitbox.co.uk/) ###

We require all of the mentors that are in contact with students from schools
and colleges to have a <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> check
done. Doing so comes at a cost, but thanks to Southampton University Community
Volunteering we are able to get them done for free. This has been a great help.

### [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/)

We provide our teams with a browser-based IDE to develop their robot's software in.  BrowserStack has kindly provided us with an account that we can use for testing this IDE in the various different browsers that our teams use.

### [British Amateur Television Club](http://www.batc.org.uk/)

During the competition, we like to provide a live stream of the event so people unable to make it on the day can see what's happening.
For SR2014, the British Amateur Television Club kindly ran this for us,
 freeing up volunteers to help the teams more while also providing a much better stream.
