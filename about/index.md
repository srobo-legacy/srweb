About Student Robotics
======================

What is Student Robotics?
-------------------------

Student Robotics is an independent organisation which runs an annual robotics [competition](/schools/game) for students around the ages of 16 to 18.
The competition game varies slightly each year, and is always designed to challenge the competitors to find their own routes to success.

Our main aim is to share our excitement about engineering with others.
Thanks to our [sponsors](/about/sponsors), one of the ways we achieve this is to allow the competitors
(usually from schools &amp; sixth-form colleges) to participate for very little or no cost.

To that end we have designed, built and tested a [robotics kit](/schools/kit) which is loaned to each team for the duration of the competition.
In addition each team is given a [budget](/schools/support#Budget) to help towards other parts (materials for the robot and motors, for example).
