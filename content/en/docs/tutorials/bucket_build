Pirate Ship (bucket) Construction Guide
=======================================

The aim of this tutorial is to enable you to make your own bucket, similar to those that will be used at the competition.

Materials
---------

* 4 B&Q single wheel swivel [castors](http://www.diy.com/nav/fix/hardware/ironmongery/castors/B-and-Q-Castor-Single-Wheel-Swivel-9370702), part number 3209745.
* A 300mm by 200mm piece of 6mm MDF.
* A 1m long 15mm diameter pine dowel
* A 200mm by 43mm by 68mm piece of pine.
* A [9l Really Useful Box](http://www.reallyusefulproducts.co.uk/uk/html/onlineshop/rub/b09_0litre.php) (RUB).
* Printed [markers](/docs/programming/sr/vision/markers) for the ends and sides of the box.
* 16 * M4 or M5 round head bolts at least 15mm long, plus nylocks and washers
* 5 * M4 or M5 coutersunk wood screws, at least 20mm long

It should be fine to use other materials for the wooden parts of the bucket,
 but the ones at the competition will be made using wooden components.

Note that the markers for the sides and ends of the box need to be paired correctly,
 as detailed in the [rules](/docs/rules).
As a reminder &mdash; the lowest numbered side goes with the lowest numbered end, and so on.

Some general tips when making things:

* Be absolutely certain that your measurements are correct before cutting anything.
  The rule is "measure twice, cut once".
* If you're unsure about how to cut something, prototype it by testing on a scrap piece.


Preparing the Pine Block
------------------------

A 16mm (or so) diameter hole should be drilled all the way through the shortest
 length of the pine block.
This should be just large enough to fit the pine dowel inside.

Preparing the RUB and MDF Base
-------------------------------

The MDF base should have holes drilled in the bottom for the castor
 bolts to fit through. The outermost holes are inset by ~1cm from the
 edge of the MDF.

The MDF should be placed as centrally as possible to drill the holes in
 the box for the castors, lining them up with the holes in the MDF.

The RUB should also have holes drilled in the bottom for screws to affix
 the MDF base to the RUB and the pine block. The positioning of these
 should be relative to screw positions on the MDF Sheet as described below.

This image shows the positioning of the casters and screws.

Attaching the base and inside block
-----------------------------------

The Pine block should be placed in the middle of the RUB, across the width
 with the hole that you drilled oriented vertically.
It will have some clearance at the ends, and should be placed centrally.

The MDF sheet should then be attached through the bottom of the RUB into
 the block of pine with 5 screws.
Four of these are at 2cm in from the edges of the MDF, and are ~3cm apart.

The pine dowel should be inserted into the hole and the fifth central
 screw should be screwed into the base of the pine dowel.

Attaching the Casters
---------------------

The 4 casters need to be attached to the MDF, through the RUB with the
 bolts.
This will also further secure the MDF bottom to the pirate ship.

Final Steps
-----------

[<img class="left" src="/images/content/tutorials/bucket_build/5_small.jpg" />](/images/content/tutorials/bucket_build/5.jpg)
Attach the markers you've printed to the ends and sides of the bucket.
Take care that you don't crumple the markers,
 and that you don't cover the borders of the markers when attaching them.
You can then admire your newly built Pirate Ship!
