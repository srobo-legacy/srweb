Walkthrough
===========

The aim of this walkthrough is to take you through &mdash; step-by-step &mdash;
 the process of writing code and running it on the kit.
We'll start off with a [_hello world_ program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program),
 the first program most programmers write in every language.
As Student Robotics involves a lot of electronics,
 we'll use a slightly adapted _hello world_ program which flashes an LED on the [power board](/docs/kit/power_board) instead.

Once that's up and running, we'll continue to advance what the examples
 (additional tutorials) do up to a point where the vision software is used.
You should, in theory, be able to do anything then (well, if you read the other documentation, anyway!).

Hello World!
------------

The aim for our _hello world_ program is to flash an LED.
We'll turn it on for 1 second, then turn it off for 1 second, then on... ad infinitum.
This should take you through all you need to do to write a basic program for you robot (kit).

Here goes...

### Writing the code

To write code for your robot, you will need to use the Student Robotics [IDE](/ide).
An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a suite of tools intended to help the developer with their programming tasks.
For you, the SR IDE provides a code editor, file manager, and code checker.
For more reference material on the IDE, please visit the [IDE section](/docs/IDE/) under docs.

Let's begin.
In a new browser tab or window, open the [IDE](/ide).
You should be presented with a screen like this:

![Login Screen](/images/content/tutorials/walkthrough/login.png)

Enter your login details and click _Log In_.
(Your team leader should have created a [user account](/docs/user_accounts) for you,
 if not you'll need to ask them to do that before you can continue this walkthrough.)
You will now be presented with a screen something like the following (it may not be exactly the same):

![project page](/images/content/tutorials/walkthrough/project_page.png)

You're on the _Projects_ page.
On the left-hand side, you'll see a button labeled _New Project_;
 when you click it, a dialog box will appear asking for the project's name.
Call it "walkthrough", and click _Save_:

![new project](/images/content/tutorials/walkthrough/new_project.png)

OK, now we're ready to write some code! When the robot tries to run code
 (the _run_ button is pressed, or the robot's started automatically at the competition),
 it looks for a file called "robot.py".
You'll find that the IDE has already created this file for you.
So, click on line that says "robot.py" in the middle of the IDE's webpage.
You'll now be presented with a code editor to write the code in, like this:

![empty robot.py open in the editor](/images/content/tutorials/walkthrough/empty_file_editor.png)

In the editor, write (or paste!) the following:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
from sr.robot import *
import time

R = Robot()

while True:
    R.power.led[0] = 1
    time.sleep(1)
    R.power.led[0] = 0
    time.sleep(1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

you should see something like this:

![LED flashing code in editor](/images/content/tutorials/walkthrough/flash_code_in_editor.png)

Let's dissect that to see what's going on:

On the first line, we have an `import` statement.
This tells Python (the programming language the robot code is written in) to get the SR module.
Doing so allows objects like `Robot` (and some others) to be used in your code.
This is essential &mdash; without it, you will not be able to control your robot!

'`while True:`' effectively means loop forever.
Any logical expression (or anything that can evaluate to `True` or `False`) can come after the `while` keyword,
 and the body of code within the `while` loop will be executed until the condition becomes `False`.
In this case, however, it is always `True`, hence the infinite loop.
Notice the indentation in the code; this is how Python knows what code belongs to what.
Indentation is one of the main issues you'll come across that causes your program to act in unexpected ways or not at all.
In short, use four spaces (which, in the IDE, the `[TAB]` key will make for you) to indent code.

The remaining chunk of code (from within the `while` loop) is as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
R.power.led[0] = 1
time.sleep(1)
R.power.led[0] = 0
time.sleep(1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefly, these lines turn LED0 on, wait for a second, turn LED0 off, and wait for another second.
This is then repeated (it's in a while loop).
To read more detailed information about the `power` object,
see its [page in the documentation](/docs/programming/sr/power/).

We're now ready to save the changes to the file.
At the upper left-hand side of the screen, you'll see a button labelled _Save_.
Click it, and you'll be presented with a dialogue box for saving the file.
The top part of this box contains an overview of the actual changes to the file,
 which can be useful to check that you're only changing what you expected to change:

![commit changes dialog](/images/content/tutorials/walkthrough/commit_changes.png)

Write a useful [commit message](/docs/IDE/good_commit_messages) in the bottom of the box &mdash; here's mine:

<pre class="not-code">
Added "hello world" (LED flashing) to robot.py

Flashes LED0 on for a second and then off for a second, then repeats.
</pre>

Now click _Save_.

OK, so we've written some code, and we now need to test it on the kit.
However, there's some other things to do first, like getting the code onto the memory stick.

### Getting the code on the memory stick

If you head back to the project tab, you'll now see our "robot.py" listed as a file in the "walkthrough" project.
On the left-hand side, you'll see a button labeled _Export Project_.
When you click this, the IDE will perform some checks on your code.
If the code is fine, you'll be presented with a browser dialogue box offering a file "robot.zip" for download
 (this is for Firefox &mdash; other browsers will look different, but the idea is the same):

![robot.zip download](/images/content/tutorials/walkthrough/robot_zip_download.png)

All you need to do now is save the file on to the root (as in `G:\` or `H:\` or whatever the drive letter is) of the robot's memory stick.
You may have to overwrite an existing "robot.zip" if one already exists (or you could rename it if there's space).

<div class="warning">The code you want to run MUST be in the exported "robot.zip"; it will not be used otherwise.</div>

You should now _safely remove_ the memory stick from the computer and prepare the kit for running the code.


### Preparing the kit

To run the _hello world_ program, all you need is the following:

* The [power board](/docs/kit/power_board)
* A SRIC cable
* The battery (charged, of course)
* The cable to connect the battery to the power board
* The USB hub
* The memory stick (with the _hello world_ code on it, from before)

To assemble, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the power board power switch in the OFF position
2. Plug the single SRIC cable into both SRIC ports on the power board
3. Plug the USB hub into the USB socket on the power board
4. Plug the memory stick into the USB hub
5. Connect the battery cable to the battery.
6. Plug the other end of the battery cable into the power board.

<div class="info">
You need to connect the power board to itself with the SRIC cable as it needs a complete token ring in order to work.
Any completed ring would work, a single cable onto itself is merely the simplest.
</div>

OK, we're ready to run the code.


### Running the code

If you've followed all of the above, you should now be ready to see a flashing LED on the power board.

Turn the power board switch on and allow the system to boot.
You should see the SR logo on the display.
When it's finished booting, you can press the _run_ button on the power board.
If you see a flashing LED (on for a second, off for a second),
 feel free to bask in the glory of having successfully programmed your Student Robotics kit.
Well done! If you don't, try and [troubleshoot](/docs/troubleshooting/) the issue.


Next Steps
----------

Now you've written a basic program for your kit and know how to get your code on it,
 we can move towards some more advanced (and more interesting) programs.
If you head back to the [tutorials](/docs/tutorials/) page, you'll find a list of other tutorials to do.
The recommended one to do next would be [Basic Motor Control](/docs/tutorials/basic_motor_control).

But, if you're feeling happy about the steps necessary to get your robot running,
 feel free to just use the [API reference](/docs/programming/sr/).
The subsections contain a lot of information on using a particular object &mdash;
 including examples &mdash; so, in theory, that should be all you need.
