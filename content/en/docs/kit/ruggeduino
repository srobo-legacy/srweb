# Ruggeduino

The Ruggeduino board allows you to connect the SR kit to your own electronics.
This board is very similar to an Arduino which you may have used before.
It has 14 digital I/O pins, these pins can either input or output a digital signal.
5V logic is used to interface with the Ruggeduino (Note: This is different from the 3.3V on the old JointIO boards).
The board also has 6 analogue input pins, these pins can read an analogue signal from 0 to 5V.
The board has a 3.3V pin, a 5V pin and three 0V/ground pins which can be used to power external devices.
If for whatever reason the board does not seem to be working pressing the reset button will reset the Ruggeduino and may solve the problem.

## Considerations

As protection the Ruggeduino has a 220ohm resistor connected to each of its pins.
This will need to be considered when attaching external components.
For example: Normally a current limiting resistor is needed in series with a standard LED,
when using the Ruggeduino to drive the LED a current limiting resistor is not required.
