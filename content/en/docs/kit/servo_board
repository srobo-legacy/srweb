Servo Board
===========

The Servo Board can be used to control up to 12 RC servos.
Many devices are available that can be controlled as servos, such as RC motor speed controllers, and these can also be used with the board.

|  Parameter                               |   Value   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Number of servo channels                 | 12        |
| Nominal input voltage                    | 11.1V Â± 15% |
| Output voltage                           | 5.5V      |
| Maximum total output current [^1]        | 10A       |

[^1]: If the auxiliary input is connected, outputs 8-11 have an independent maximum current.
