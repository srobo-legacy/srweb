Servo Board
===========

<img src="/images/content/kit/servo_board.png" alt="A photo of an un-cased servo board" title="An un-cased servo board" class="right" />
The Servo Board can be used to control up to 8 RC servos.
Many devices are available that can be controlled as servos such as RC motor speed controllers and these can also be used with the board.

The servo board needs to be powered from the motor rail on the [power board](/docs/kit/power_board) in order to power the servos.
Without this, the "5V Power LED" won't light, and the servos won't do anything,
but the kit will not report any problems with the board.

All dimensions are in mm. Don't forget that the CAT5 cables stick out slightly.
