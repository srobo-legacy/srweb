Motor Board
===========

<img src="/images/content/kit/mcv4b.png" alt="A phot of an un-cased motor board" title="An un-cased motor board" class="right" />
The Motor Board can be used to control two 12V DC motors. Your kit contains two of these boards to allow you to control up to four motors. These can be used for moving your robot, although don't feel you are limited to using them for this purpose.

The speed and direction of the two outputs are controlled independently through the USB interface.
The USB interface is isolated from the rest of the board to prevent damage to the host in the case of a board failure.
Due to this isolation the board must have power applied to the power connector, from the motor rail on the power board, to function.
If the board does not have power applied to the power connector then the kit will report that there is a problem with the motor board.
