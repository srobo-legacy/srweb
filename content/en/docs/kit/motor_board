Motor Board
===========

<img src="/images/content/kit/motor_board.png" alt="A photo of an un-cased motor board" title="An un-cased motor board" class="right" />
The Motor Board can be used to control a single 12V DC motor. Your kit contains two of these boards to allow you control motors for moving your robot although don't feel you are limited to using them for this purpose.

Board Diagram

Note that there are now two revisions of the motor board in the wild.
The 'SR13.F' revision does not have the feedback connector and associated components.
It also lacks the current limiting components (the current limiting has been disabled on SR11.F boards too).

Indicators
----------

|   LED           | Meaning                | Inital power-up state
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------
| Power           | The board is powered   | On
| SRIC Activity   | The board is transferring data | Off
| Token           | The token-ring is functioning | On
| Motor Power     | The motor has power and will turn when instructed to | Off
| Current Limit   | Unused                 | Off
| Feedback        | Undefined              | Off
| Motor           | Brightness shows power, LED shows direction | Off

After you have started your code the `Motor power LED` should come on.

Note that the red Motor LED (which indicates a forward/positive drive) on the 'SR13.F' revision motor board does not function due to an assembly defect, this does not affect the primary function of the board.

Case Dimensions
---------------

All dimensions are in mm. Don't forget that the CAT5 cables stick out slightly.

Specification
-------------

|  Parameter                           |   Value   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| Absolute Maximum Input Voltage       | 16V       |
| Output Voltage                       | 12V       |
| Maximum Output Current               | 5A        |
| PWM Frequency                        | 324Hz     |
| PWM Duty Cycle Range                 | 0-99%     |
| PWM Duty Cycle Steps (per direction) | 100       |

It was found that the design of the current limiting circuit was not sufficiently robust so it was disabled, therefore the motor board does not have any current limiting.
There should be fewer problems with motors not operating correctly, however care must be taken that the output is not over-loaded or shorted.
If the output of a motor board is shorted then the main power fuse on the power board will blow and you may damage the motor board itself, so take great care.
