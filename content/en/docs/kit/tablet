Tablet
======

The tablet provided with your kit allows you to interface with and debug your
robot.

Connecting to the robot
-----------------------

First you should make sure the tablet is connected to your robot's WiFi. This
should happen automatically when you turn on the tablet if the robot is also
powered up. If there is a problem you can manually connect to the robot by
finding your WiFi key from the `wifi.yaml` file inside the `robot.zip` from the
IDE which should be on your memory stick. If you are still experiencing
problems, you should ask a question on the [forum](/forum).

Once you have a WiFi connection, you can open the "Student Robotics" app which
will open the browser and display the tablet interface for your robot. If you
are experiencing problems with the app, you can try connecting to the robot
manually by opening the "Chrome Shell" app from the apps list and navigating to
`http://robot.sr/`.

<div class="warning">
If the tablet is already connected to a WiFi access point before turning on the
robot, it will not automatically switch to the robot access point. You will
need to do that yourselves by either disconnecting from the original access
point or by selecting the robot one in the WiFi settings screen on the tablet.
