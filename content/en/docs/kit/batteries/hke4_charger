=======================

Some kits will contain a black HobbyKing HKE4 charger.
This charger is simpler and easier to use than the iMAX B6 charger, while retaining all of the functionality required for charging the batteries supplied with the kit.
The charging lead is cable-tied to the charger and you must not remove this cable.
The charging lead is terminated with 4mm bullet connectors, which present a very high risk of shorting the battery if removed from the charger.
