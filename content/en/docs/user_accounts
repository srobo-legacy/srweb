User Accounts
=============

Your User Account can be used to access the various online services that we host.
These include the [forums](/forum), [IDE](/ide) and, for [team-leaders](/schools/team-leaders),
a [user management interface](/userman).

Getting an Account
------------------
If you don't yet have an account, you should contact your team-leader,
usually your teacher, who will be able to create one for you.
They will need:

 * Your first and last names
 * Your email address &mdash; be sure to give them one you use regularly since
   we will _very_ occasionally send you important information to it
 * Which team you are in (if there is more than one team at your college)

Once your team leader has entered your details into the user management interface
you will receive an email with a link to activate your account.

Please allow at least 10 minutes for the email to be sent,
however if you've been waiting longer than this you should check with your team-leader that the account was created,
and ask them to email <accounts@studentrobotics.org> if the problem remains.

Forgotten Something?
--------------------
If you forget your user name or password, you should contact your team-leader,
usually your teacher.
They will be able to tell you the details of your account, or reset your password for you.

Password Change
---------------
If you know your password, but want to change it,
you can do this using the self service [change-password](/password) form.

Other Problems
--------------
If your team-leader was unable to resolve your account issue,
you can ask them to [contact us](/about/contactus) for more help.
