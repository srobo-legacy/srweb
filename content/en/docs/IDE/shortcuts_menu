The shortcuts menu in the IDE
=============================

There are a number of IDE features that aren't needed all the time,
but which are useful to have when you do want them.
These are kept in the *shortcuts menu*, which is always the left-most tab in the tab-bar.

Once expanded, the menu offers buttons to create a new file,
start a search,
change IDE [settings](/docs/IDE/user_settings),
edit your Team Status or view information about the IDE itself.
