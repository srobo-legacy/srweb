Resources for Team Leaders
==========================

Every team that competes in Student Robotics must be associated with a responsible adult.
This person is that team's **team leader**.
Most team leaders are volunteers, and their effort makes Student Robotics possible.

The team leader is responsible for the following:

 * Ensuring that all the requirements of the school, college, or organisation that the members of their team are associated with are met - for example, [risk assessments](#RiskAssessment).
 * Providing team member details to us so that we can give them [accounts](#UserAccounts).
 * Ensuring that all team members, and team guests attending the competition, have registered for a ticket.
See [tickets](#Tickets).

[Risk Assessment](/schools/team-leaders/#RiskAssessment) {#RiskAssessment}
-----------------

Most schools require that activities or outings they engage in with their students are risk-assessed.
In order to reduce paperwork, we provide some risk assessments that may be suitable:

 * [SR2012 Competition Risk Assessment (draft)](/resources/2012/risk/competition.pdf)

[User Accounts](/schools/team-leaders/#UserAccounts) {#UserAccounts}
---------------

It is important that every team member has a Student Robotics user account.
It is these accounts that allow them to access the [IDE](/ide) and the [forums](/forum), which are both vital to the operation of the team.

The signup process for these accounts is simple.
The team leader needs to send an email to [info@studentrobotics.org](mailto:info@studentrobotics.org) containing the following for each team member (and themselves):

 * First name
 * Last name
 * Email address

When we receive this information, we create user accounts for the listed individuals.
Subsequently, these people will each receive an email containing their username and password.

Please note that it is important that this information contains the first *and last* names of the team members.
This is so that the team member's details can later be associated with media consent forms.

[Tickets](/schools/team-leaders/#Tickets) {#Tickets}
---------

Every person attending the competition will require a ticket.
A prerequisite for receiving a ticket is that Student Robotics has received a signed media consent form for that person.
This form should be sent via mail or given to Student Robotics and once we have recieved it a [ticket](https://studentrobotics.org/tickets/ "Download your ticket now") can downloaded and printed.

 * [SR2012 Media Consent Form](/resources/2012/mediaconsent.pdf)

Note that the ticket system is new for SR2012 (previous events did not require them).
