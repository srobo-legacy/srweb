<h1>How to Enter</h1>

<p>
	If you are new to Student Robotics and would like to ask any questions regarding the competition,
	please do <a href="/about/contactus">get in contact with us</a>.
	You can also have a look at the <a href="/teams/">teams</a> that are competing this year.
</p>

<p>
	Student Robotics teams usually have about 4-6 sixth&ndash;form and college students (ages 16-18),
	plus an adult <a href="/schools/team-leaders/">team-leader</a> who is able to take responsibility for the competitors (usually a teacher).
	If you'd like to enter a team with a different make-up,
	please do <a href="/about/contactus">get in contact with us</a>,
	but note that the presence of an adult team-leader is mandatory.
</p>
<p>
	You can register your interest in submitting a team using the form below.
	Please note that we have a limited number of spaces, and your place in the competition is not guaranteed until the confirmation date (see below).
	If you do not have a team of competitors when you register,  you should start recruiting immediately after confirmation, in time for the <a href="/events/kickstart">kickstart</a> event.
