	plus an adult <a href="/schools/team-leaders/">team-leader</a> who is able to take responsibility for the competitors (usually a teacher).
	If you'd like to enter a team with a different make-up,
	please do <a href="/about/contactus">get in contact with us</a>,
	but note that the presence of an adult team-leader is mandatory.
