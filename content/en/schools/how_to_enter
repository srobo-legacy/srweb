<h1>How to Enter</h1>

<p>
	If you are new to Student Robotics and would like to express interest in taking part in the competition,
	please do <a href="/about/contactus">get in contact with us</a>.
	You can also have a look at the <a href="/teams/">teams</a> that are competing this year.
</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>

<p>
	Student Robotics teams are generally comprised of about 4-6 sixth&ndash;form and college students (ages 16-18),
	plus an adult <a href="/schools/team-leaders/">team-leader</a> (usually a teacher).
	If you'd like to enter a team with a different make-up,
	please do <a href="/about/contactus">get in contact with us</a>,
	but note that the presence of a responsible adult team-leader is required.
</p>
