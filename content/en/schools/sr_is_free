Student Robotics is Free
========================

From its inception Student Robotics has always strived to reduce the barrier to entry for teams wishing to take part in a robotics competition. We do this in various ways, some technical and some not so technical. The most obvious of these is that we do not charge for entry into the competition. In fact, we provide teams with a small [budget](/schools/support#Budget) of around Â£75 (note that this may vary slightly from year to year).

The following things are provided completely free of charge to each team taking part in the competition:

 * Full [electronics kit](/schools/kit) including batteries, battery charger and boards for interfacing with motors, etc.[^1]
 * Web-based [IDE](/schools/support#IDE) (Integrated Development Environment) to write code for the robot
 * A selection of mechanical bits and bobs (nuts, bolts, aluminium angle, etc.)
 * Hands-on support in the form of university and industry mentors
 * On-line support in the Student Robotics forum

However, at this time, we cannot cover travel expenses or accommodation. It is therefore up to the teams to cover the cost of travel to Kickstart, Tech Days and the Competition. Note that the Competition is a two day event so most teams will need overnight accommodation.

[^1]: The electronics kit is loaned to teams for the period of the competition and we expect it to be returned after the competition. If a team does not attend a Kickstart event then they will have to organise and pay for a courier to have the kit delivered to them.
