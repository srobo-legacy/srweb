The competition
===============

The competition game for 2012,
 as announced at [KickStart](/schools/kickstart),
 is called *Pirate Plunder*.
It has considerably more scope for interesting robot activity than our previous games.
Autonomous robots will be racing to collect cube-shaped tokens,
 and get them back to the bucket in their home zone.
Robots can also steal each other's buckets,
 leading to an variety of possible tactics.
The full rules of the game can be found in our [documentation pages](/docs/rules).

Event
-----

The competition itself is a two day event,
 held at the University of Southampton.
The first day is very much like a centralised [Tech Day](/schools/tech_days) &ndash;
 it provides an opportunity to test the robots in the real arena,
 and to work out any problems they may have amongst a plethora of experience provided by the mentors that will be present.
On the second day the competition itself begins.
Every robot will have many chances in the arena,
 but at the end of the day only one will emerge victorious.

2011

In 2011 the competition game involved a track-based arena with some scattered baked bean tins to pick up.
The arena can be seen in the diagram to the right.
Full details about the game played last year is still available in the [rules](/docs/rules/).

Last year the competition was on the weekend of the 9th and 10th of April, 2011.

Further event details and the results are available from the
 [news article](/news/2011-05-04_sr2011_comp_happened) posted shortly afterwards.
