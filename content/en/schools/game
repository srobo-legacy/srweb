The Game {#2017}
================

The Student Robotics 2017 game is in development and will be announced at [Kickstart](/events/kickstart).


[2016](#2016) {#2016}
---------------------

In the 2016 game, *Sunny Side Up*, the robots were challenged to turn tokens so that their side faced upwards.
Additional points could be scored by moving suitably turned tokens into the robots' corner zone.

There were a limited number of tokens in the arena and any robot could move or turn any token.
As a result robots competed with each other to turn (and re-turn) tokens to score points.

Full details about Sunny Side Up, the scoring method and more, are available in the [rulebook](/resources/2016/rulebook.pdf).

[2015](#2015) {#2015}
---------------------

The 2015 game, *Capture the Flag*, took simplicity to the extreme. Robots scored points by moving flags into their scoring zone. The robot with the most flags at the end scored the most points. Simple.

We made things a little more tricky by adding barriers between teams' zones. However, this seemingly simple game proved to be quite a challenge to our 2015 robots and just goes to show you should never underestimate the importance of reliability in a design.

The [full rules](/resources/2015/rulebook.pdf) contain further details of the game, prizes and regulations of the 2015 game.

[2014](#2014) {#2014}
---------------------

The 2014 game, *Slots*, saw an interesting new dimension added to the game as the tokens had a right-way-up.

Points could be scored by:

 * righting the tokens (which started upside-down)
 * moving them into either:
    * a slot (which could hold one token)
    * a zone (with the aim of having the most tokens in a zone)

Full details about the game, the scoring method and more, remain available in the [rulebook](/resources/2014/rulebook.pdf).

[2013](#2013) {#2013}
---------------------

The 2013 competition, *A Strange Game*, saw thirty teams build robots looking to dominate a game of noughts and crosses.
Each robot, equipped with six rather large cardboard boxes, attempted to take-over squares in a 3x3 grid in the centre of an arena.
The more squares owned in a row or column, the more points a robot would score.
For further details about the game see the [full rules](/resources/2013/rulebook.pdf).

[2012](#2012) {#2012}
---------------------

The 2012 competition, *Pirate Plunder*, considerably increased the scope for interesting activity compared to our previous games.
Autonomous robots raced to collect cube-shaped tokens and get them back to the bucket in their home zone.
Robots could also steal each other's buckets, leading to an variety of possible tactics.
The [full rules](/resources/2012/rulebook.pdf) of the 2012 game are available for those interested.

[2011](#2011) {#2011}
---------------------

<img src="/images/content/arena.png" alt="A diagram of the SR2011 arena" class="right" />
In 2011 the competition game involved a track-based arena with some scattered baked bean tins to pick up.
The arena can be seen in the diagram to the right.
Full details about the game played in 2011 are available in the [rules](/resources/2011/rulebook.pdf).

Further event details and the results are available from the
 [news article](/news/2011-05-04_sr2011_comp_happened) posted shortly afterwards.
