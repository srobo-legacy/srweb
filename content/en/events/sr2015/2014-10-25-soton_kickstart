courier during the week following. Couriered kits should be insured for
Â£500, please [contact us](mailto:info@studentrobotics.org) for collection
details.

If you think that you will have difficulty doing this (e.g: overseas teams),
then please let us know in advance. We are able to assist a limited number
of teams with shipping if you are unable to collect them at KickStart.
