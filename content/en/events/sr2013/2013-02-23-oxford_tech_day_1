  ([Directions](http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/Location.aspx).)

Who: All Student Robotics teams are welcome to attend.
  You need to [inform us](/about/contactus) if your team is coming, as we need
  to arrange temporary site passes.

Food: There are no food outlets on site open at the weekend, so bring a packed
  lunch, or money for a pizza order.

Kit: We can't provide any kit for this event - please bring laptops, any tools
  you intend to use, etc.
  WiFi will be available.
