Parking
-------

Most car parks on campus are free for use by the public at weekends. The
closest car park is the “Pay and Display” car park (with no charge at weekends)
just north of Building 32; take the first left on University Road coming from
the north. There are also multiple car parks quite close by along Salisbury
Road, which is the first right on University Road coming from the north.

For more information, including the use of a dedicated visitors car park,
please visit [the university website](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/estates/services/carparking/).

Computing requirements
----------------------

The event is taking place in a computing lab so laptops will not be necessary,
however you are welcome to bring them if you wish.
