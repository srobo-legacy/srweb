Parking

Unfortunately the university cannot provide parking for this event. A quick google maps search should highlight a number of suitable car parks to park in on the day.

 TBC - check back soon.


Computing requirements
----------------------

This year at Bristol, we'll be giving all attendees guest logins to
the University's computers. Also for the first time you will be able to connect to university wi-fi with "The Cloud" so if you
want to bring your own laptop that's fine.
