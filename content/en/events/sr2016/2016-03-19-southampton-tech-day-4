Parking
-------

Car parking is available on Highfield campus for free, however this would
require transporting your equipment to the Boldrewood campus which is about a
15 minute walk. Alternatively you can drop off the equipment at Boldrewood and
return to Highfield to park.

If you choose to park at Boldrewood itself, there is more information available on
[the university website](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/transport/parking/visitor-parking.page).
Specifically, it states that:

> Any visitors To Avenue Campus, Boldrewood Campus or the University of
> Southampton Winchester Campus should request a permit from the campus reception.

Computing requirements
----------------------

The event is taking place in an engineering design studio so access to desktop
computers is unavailable. We will be providing laptops to teams which need them,
but we highly recommend that at least one member of your team brings their own.
