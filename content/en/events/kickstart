KickStart
=========

Shortly after the start of the academic year (around mid September in the UK)
 we hold a central event that all the teams are invited to called "KickStart".
This is the beginning of the journey for the teams,
 and it is where the game that their robots will have to compete in is revealed.

KickStart provides an opportunity for the teams get to meet their competitors,
 and take part in a mini-game that gets them thinking about the types of challenges they will face over the coming months.
They are also given talks about a number of skills key to Student Robotics
 which they may not already have.
The topics of these talks have included Mechanical assembly, Prototyping, Electronics, Coding and Project Management.

### Kit Delivery

We expect that the majority of teams will be able to collect their kits
at KickStart. Alternatively, you can arrange for it to be collected by
courier during the week following. Couriered kits should be insured for
Â£500, please [contact us](mailto:info@studentrobotics.org) for collection
details.

If you think that you will have difficulty doing this (e.g: overseas teams),
then please let us know in advance. We are able to assist a limited number
of teams with shipping if you are unable to collect them at KickStart.
