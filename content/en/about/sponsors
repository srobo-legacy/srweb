...the people who make the dream of Student Robotics a Reality
--------------------------------------------------------------

Student Robotics depends entirely on the generous donations from Southampton
University, ECS & Engineering companies. The following companies were heavily
involved in the 2010-11 competition sponsorship.

### [Motorola Foundation](http://responsibility.motorola.com/index.php/community/motofoundation/) ###

The Motorola Foundation is the primary sponsor of Student Robotics. They have
provided most of the money needed to make it all happen.


### [University of Southampton's School of Electronics and Computer Science](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) ###

<abbr title="School of Electronics and Computer Science">ECS</abbr> not
only provide us a place to meet and work, they have helped in other areas
including a lot of the design of this website.
Last summer ECS employed two interns to work on behalf of Student Robotics,
 allowing us to develop our new website and kit.
This summer ECS are once again employing an intern to develop the kit,
 focusing on the vision component.


### [BitBox](http://www.bitbox.co.uk/) ###

Back for 2011, BitBox have helped us manufacture several parts of the Student Robotics kit in previous years.
They will be manufacturing the kit for next year's competition as well as offering support for teams.

We require all of the mentors that are in contact with students from schools
and colleges to have a <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> check
done. Doing so comes at a cost, but thanks to Southampton University Community
Volunteering we are able to get them done for free. This has been a great help.
