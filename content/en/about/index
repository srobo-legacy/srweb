About Student Robotics
======================

What is Student Robotics?
-------------------------

Student Robotics run an annual robotics [competition](/schools/competition) for sixth-form schools and colleges, with the main events held at the University of Southampton. All of the [kit](/schools/kit) the schools &amp; colleges use is designed, built, tested and distributed by us. Student Robotics is run, in its entirety, by a [team](/about/committee) of university students &mdash; mainly from the Universities of [Southampton](http://www.soton.ac.uk) and [Bristol](http://bristol.ac.uk).

One of the main aims for us is to allow schools &amp; colleges to participate for very little or no cost: each team is given the electronics kit &mdash; for free &mdash; and a budget to help towards other parts (materials for the robot and motors, for example). To read more about what we aim to do, you might like to take a look at our [mission statement](/about/mission).

Lightning Talks
---------------

Student Robotics sometimes present lightning talks, keeping everyone updated; they can be found on their own [lightning talks](/about/lightning_talks) page.
