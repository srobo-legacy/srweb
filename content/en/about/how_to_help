How to Help
===========

Schools and Colleges
--------------------

We would love it if more schools (with sixth-forms) and colleges got involved.
The [competition](/schools) gets better and better each year, and can only get better with more teams!
Head over to the [How to Enter](/schools/how_to_enter) page to find out more.

Volunteers
----------

We are always looking for more volunteers to help.
If you are interested in getting involved, email <info@studentrobotics.org> to get in touch.

### Mentor teams

We send volunteers out to teams to help them with their robot.
You don't need to be an expert already;
 it's most important to encourage teams to get things done,
 and to help them solve problems.

> "I expected it to be more like teaching, but it was more about supporting the teams.
> I think that's a good idea because it doesn't waste their time." &mdash; Andy Barrett-Sprot

### Competition

We run three types of event a year: [Kickstart](/events/kickstart),
[Tech Days](/events/tech_days) and the [Competition](/events/competition) itself.
Especially at the competition, we're in need of volunteers for many different roles,
including setting up, doing safety checks, coordinating teams, scoring games, and many others.
No previous experience necessary.

### Development

All our software and hardware is open source (see [our Git repositories](/git)).
If you're interested in contributing, pop onto our [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/srobo)
or the [srobo-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/srobo-devel) mailing list.

### Volunteers getting together

Besides the events that we run, there are groups that regularly meet at the following locations:

 * University of Southampton
 * University of Bristol
 * University of Surrey
 * Technische Universität München

Sponsors
--------

Student Robotics really couldn't happen without our [sponsors](/about/sponsors).
We're looking for organisations to support us with funding, time or services (such as printing or equipment).
If your organisation is interested, contact <info@studentrobotics.org>.
