Competition dates for SR2016 announced
======================================

The competition venue and dates for SR2016 have now [been confirmed](/events/sr2016/2016-04-30-competition).
Once again the competition will return to the [Newbury Racecourse](http://www.newburyracecourse.co.uk/)
Grandstand which has successfully hosted the competition over the past
two years.

The competition weekend will be the 30th April and 1st May.
Over the two day event the teams' robots will first compete in a series of
league matches, during which they will continue to improve their hardware
and software. These matches will then seed a knockout to choose the overall
winners.

In each match the robots will play [*Sunny Side Up*](/schools/game),
in which the aim is to turn as many of the nine tokens the right way up
and then collect as many as they can into their home zone.

In addition to the coveted 1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes, there are awards for
the highest placed new team, the most ingenious robot and the best presented
team among others. For full details of the rules of the game and the prizes
available see the [rulebook](/resources/2016/rulebook.pdf).

Whether you're supporting a team or just want to watch, the competition
is open to everyone over the whole weekend. We particularly recommend
coming along for the finals on Sunday afternoon.
