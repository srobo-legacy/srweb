Oxford school wins smart robot tournament
=========================================

Headington School in Oxford came top of the class in a high-tech European robotics tournament held this weekend at Newbury Racecourse.
The team of 6th form girls beat 53 other school teams from the UK, France and Germany with a self-driving robot that used a camera to find prize tokens.

About Student Robotics
----------------------
Student Robotics, a school robotics tournament run by students at Southampton and Bristol University,
 has grown over the past 6 years to be the UK's leading competition.
Teams of 6th formers have 6 months to design, build and program a robot to take part in the annual competition.

Student Robotics 2014 was the biggest and best yet, with over 230 rounds played over 2 days.
Four robots compete head to head in each round, pushing past each other to grab as many tokens as possible in 3 minutes.
Run entirely by volunteers, Student Robotics is free for teams to enter thanks to sponsorship from the Motorola Foundation.


The challenge: *Slots*
----------------------
Given only the brain and eyes of the robot,
 the teams must work out how to make their robot move around the arena
 (this year saw the competition's first walking robot),
 how it will pick up the prize tokens as well as how to build it.
This year's game presented a variety of point scoring opportunities,
 including moving the prize tokens to certain places and turning them the right way up.

Prizes
------

Student Robotics try to recognise not only the robots which make it all the way to the final,
 but also encourages those teams which excel in other areas.
To that end, there are a variety of other prizes awarded each year.

The *First Robot Movement* and *Rookie Award* prizes are reserved for teams new to the competition.
The *Rookie Award* is given to the rookie team which places highest in the league stage of the competition.

The first new team to post a video of their robot moving on its own in a controlled manner win the *First Robot Movement* award.
This encourages new teams to get a basic chassis built quickly, as well as getting them to write some simple control software for it.

//TODO: Maybe link to TBG's video?

The *Committee Award* is given to the team which finds a simple and elegant solution to a problem.
This was demonstrated brilliantly by MAI,
 whose robot used a suction grabber to roll the tokens towards it in order to turn them over as well as easily carry them.

The *Online Presence* prize is given to the team judged to have the best combination of website, blog and other online activities.

The *Robot and Team Image* prize is given to the team which present their robot and themselves in the most outstanding way.
Systemetric (HRS) impressed the judges with their steampunk? victorian? costumes and brass and mahogany robot.
