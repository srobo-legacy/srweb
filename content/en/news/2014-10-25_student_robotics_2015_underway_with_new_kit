Kit upgrades
------------
Student Robotics volunteers have worked hard producing a new range of kit for Student Robotics 2015.
These upgrades include:

### New power board

### Brain board

The new Brain Board is the [Odroid U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php).
It's a small but powerful Linux computer with a 1.7GHz Quad Core ARM processor and packs 2GB of RAM.
These boards are similar, but are often reported as being between 6 and 12 times more powerful than the Raspberry Pi.

### Tablets

### New servo board

The new inter-board communication system has been upgraded from SRIC to USB. This makes communication faster, wiring easier, and the kit more robust.


This years competition should be an exhilarating event, and all of the Student Robotics volunteers are looking forward to seeing how well the robots compete!
