Competition 2013 draws close
============================

There's just less than a month until thirty six teams of students converge on
the University of Southampton for the largest Student Robotics Competition to
date.

In November 2012, a lecture theatre packed with sixth formers started designing robots to take part in "A Strange Game". Robots must move large cubes onto
pedestals to form lines of tokens in a big game of noughts-and-crosses,
while stopping their rivals from scoring too. And to make it more interesting,
their robots must operate completely autonomously, only taking commands from
a python program that on board the robot.

This year the competition will be taking place at the [Students Union]
(http://data.southampton.ac.uk/building/42.htm) building at the University
of Southampton, over the 13th and 14th of April. All are welcome to attend,
note that competitors must bring their [ticket](/schools/team-leaders/#Tickets)
with them, and persons under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult.

We look forward to seeing you there, and may the best robot win!
