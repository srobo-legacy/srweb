Bishop Wordsworth's School are victorious at Student Robotics 2015
==================================================================

[Bishop Wordsworth's School][BWS] from Salisbury took 1st Place at this year's Student Robotics tournament, held at Newbury Racecourse. In a tense final, their robot "Underclocked Toaster" beat [Team Aculeus][GRD2] of Gordano School, [King Edward VI Grammar School][KEG] and [41 other teams from around the UK and Germany][teams-map] to take first place. [Cranbrook School][CRB] from Kent took the Committee Award for their simple and elegant circular robot.

Student Robotics 2015 was the first to feature only new-generation kit, with USB Servo and Power Boards, and a Brain Board based on the ODROID U3. The competition has now been running for eight years, and remains free for teams to enter thanks to [our sponsors](/about/sponsors) and [many volunteers](/about/how_to_help).

The challenge: *Capture the Flag*
---------------------------------

For [this year's game](/schools/game), the competitors had to build and program robots to capture and keep as many flags (large wooden cubes on castors) as possible within the three-minute games. Full details can be found in the [rulebook][].

The standard remained high this year, with a wide variety of approaches. Many teams chose to gamble on speed, dashing for the centre flag, bringing it back to their zone, and guarding it for the rest of the match. Others chose a more flexible approach, using their vision systems to adapt to the situation, often attempting to steal flags from their rivals. King Edward VI Grammar School's approach was to drive slowly but carefully, a strategy which paid off, winning them 3rd Place and the Rookie Award.

Prizes
------

Winning the knockout is not the only prize-worthy achievement at Student Robotics. A complete list of prizes is shown below.

| Prize                                                    | Team

| Rookie Award                                             | [King Edward VI Grammar School][KEG]
| First Robot Movement                                     | [CATS Robotics][CAT] ([proof video](http://youtu.be/NP0rywgydNw))
| Robot and Team Image                                     | [42 * 2 - Double Vision (Gymnasium Markt Indersdorf)][MAI]
| Online Presence                                          | [Peter Symonds Robotics][PSC]

The *Committee Award*, given for a simple and elegant solution to the year's challenge, was awarded to [Cranbrook School][CRB]. The committee was impressed by their simple but effective circular design, which had no need for moving parts except for its two drive wheels.

The *Rookie Award* is for the rookie team who performed best in the knockouts. The *First Movement Award* is given to the first rookie team to demonstrate a moving robot.

The *Robot and Team Image* prize is for the team which present themselves and their robot in the most outstanding and stylish manner. The winners this year, "42 * 2 - Double Vision" from Gymnasium Markt Indersdorf, came dressed as monks in hooded brown robes, laced with glowing LED strips. [Include photo.] Hoods were a major theme this year, with Systemetric from Hills Road Sixth Form College dressing as sinister black-cloaked Illuminati.

The *Online Presence* award is given to the team with the best website, social media presence, or combination of the two.

For full details of the awards, please see the [rulebook][].

44 teams made it to the competition this year, 20 of whom came from schools or colleges which had not competed before.

Student Robotics 2016 promises to be the biggest and best yet. If you'd like to compete, see [the How to Enter page](/schools/how_to_enter) for more information. Start talking to your teachers and recruiting team members as soon as possible!

Notes to editors
----------------

Student Robotics is an annual robotics competition for 16-18 year-olds in the UK and Europe. It was founded in 2006 by students from the University of Southampton and is free to enter thanks to [our sponsors](/about/sponsors) and [many volunteers](/about/how_to_help). Since it was first run in 2008, the final competition has grown from one room at the University of Southampton to a two-day event for 54 teams and over 400 students.

At the start of the academic year, teams are given a kit containing custom-made electronics at a Kickstart event, where the game for the year is announced. They then have until the end of the Easter holiday to build fully-autonomous robots which will compete against each other in the final competition. They are supported by volunteer mentors, and software to assist them in programming their robots is provided.

High resolution photographs of the event will be uploaded to [the Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/sr2015). For more information, please [get in touch](/about/contactus).
