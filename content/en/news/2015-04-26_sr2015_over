$WINNING_TEAM from $LOCATION (swept to victory|narrowly took the first prize) at this year's Student Robotics tournament, held at Newbury Racecourse. In a (decisive final|close final|tense tiebreaker) their robot $WINNING_ROBOT beat $RUNNERS_UP and $NUM_TEAMS other teams from around the UK and Germany to take first place.

Student Robotics 2015 was the first to feature only new-generation kit, with USB Servo and Power Boards, and a Brain Board based on the ODROID U3. The competition has now been running for eight years, and remains free for teams to enter thanks to [our sponsors](/about/sponsors) and [many volunteers](/about/how_to_help).

For [this year's game](/schools/game), the competitors had to build and program robots to capture and keep as many flags (large cubes on wheels) as possible within the three-minute games. [Comment on teams' tactics in the games, e.g. "Competition for the only neutral flag, in the centre of the arena, was fierce."]

Full details of the game can be found in the [rulebook][].
