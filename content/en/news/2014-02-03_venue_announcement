Newbury Racecourse Robotics
===========================

As a result of our fantastic growth in participants over the years, Student
Robotics is now far too big for the Southampton's <del>dungeon</del>
<ins>basement club</ins>. As a result, this year's two day competition event
will be held at the prestigious Newbury Racecourse[TODO: link].

Aside from the new spacious venue, the final will be business as uual. All
attendees will be required to have submitted media consent forms prior to the
event, and teams will have to arrange their own transportation, accommodation,
and mastication. We can't do it all for you!

Your team leaders should have received an email with more details, but you can
find more information about the event link here[TODO: link]. We look forward to
seeing you & your robots on April the 26<sup>th</sup>!
