Registration for SR2016 now open
================================

Registration for Student Robotics 2016 is now open and, as always, it is completely free to take part. You can [register your interest](/schools/how_to_enter) in entering a team for the next Student Robotics competition and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

The competition will kick off towards the end of October, where teams will attend one of our [Kickstart events](/events/kickstart). Teams will be introduced to the SR2016 game, the Student Robotics [Kit](/schools/kit) and set a series of small challenges to help them familiarise themselves with the Kit. Help will be on hand throughout the day from our growing team of university and industry mentors.

After spending six months carefully designing, constructing and testing their robots, teams will come together for the main competition in April 2016. Here, their robot will be pitted against all of the other teams' robots. Over two days, through a battle of minds and engineering prowess, the robots and teams will have to prove themselves with reliable and consistent performance.

So, if you have a team of 16-18 year-olds who think they have what it takes to be crowned the winners of SR2016, please [register your interest](/schools/how_to_enter) and we will get in touch with you as soon as we can.
