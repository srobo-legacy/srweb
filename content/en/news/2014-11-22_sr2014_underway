The Student Robotics 2014 competition is now under way. This year we have
three hundred students registered, across fifty four schools, and three
different countries. They now have six months to design, prototype and build
their robots, to take part in this years competition game. You can find more
information about the people taking part on their [team pages](/teams).

The Kickstart event was spread over three different locations, at the
Universities of Southampton and Bristol, and Greshams School in Norfolk.
Attending teams received their electronics kit,
[an introduction to SR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HTE_fsu4zY)
and exercised their robot
building skills through a series of tasks demonstrating the full range of
controls that our electronics kit can provide.

This year our kit has new [motor controllers](/news/2013-10-02-sr2014_mcv4),
which supports more motors and higher currents. We've also included a
[ruggediuno](/docs/kit/ruggeduino) with each kit, which can not only provide
basic input and output operation, but can also be re-programmed by teams to
provide their own functionality. We've also kept all of our past features,
such as the servo controller and vision system.

This year's game, Slots, challenges teams to collect 20cm boxes from the arena,
rotate them and place them into central zones, with bonuses for placing them in
the adjacent slots. During the competition teams have three minutes to place as many boxes as possible, competing against three other robots at a time.
After a league and knockout stage, the best robot will be crowned the SR2014
champion! Full details are available in the [rules](/docs/rules).

We're hoping that this years competition will produce the most innovative and
exciting robots that we've ever seen during Student Robotics, and are looking
forward to seeing how they perform a the Competition.
