[Royal Grammar School Guildford][RGS] took 1st place at this year's Student Robotics tournament, held at Newbury Racecourse. In a tense final, their robot beat [The Ladies' College][TLC], [Gordano School][GRD2], [Brockenhurst College][BRK] and [more than 40 other teams from around the UK and Germany][teams-map] to take first place.

The challenge: *Sunny Side Up*
------------------------------------

For [this year's game][this-game], the competitors had to build and program robots to turn tokens so that their side faces upwards. Additional points could be scored by moving suitable turned tokens into the robots' corner zone. Full details can be found in [the rulebook][rulebook].

This year featured an especially difficult challenge; to score well, teams had to program their robots to decide which way to rotate their cubes based on their orientation. It was also a difficult challenge mechanically, as teams had to engineer a system to rotate their cubes.

The standard was very high this year with some very advanced robots and a variety of approaches. From using vaccuum pumps to using a turntable, to just using a stick pointing out of the front of the robot, almost all of the robots were interesting and well designed. Some highlights were:

- [Peter Symonds College][PSC] had their webcam mounted on a servo in order to constantly build up a view of the arena.
- [Hills Road Sixth Form College][HRS] created a robot entirely out of printed circuit board.
- [Gordano School][GRD2] created a beautiful 'steam-punk' style robot with beautiful underglow.
- [Brockenhurst College][BRK] decided to flip their cubes with a giant fork-shaped flipper, atop their jumper-clad robot.
- [Clifton High School][CLF]'s robot 'Hammer-Time' flipped cubes with giant hammers, which was great fun to watch when it worked.

The *Committee Award*, given for an elegant and well made solution to this year's challenge, was awarded to [Tunbridge Wells Grammar School for Boys][TWG], for their well thought out design; arms with two degrees of movement and a turntable.

The *Rookie Award* is for the rookie team who performed best in the knock-outs. This year the team from [The Ladies' College][TLC] managed to achieve 2nd Place, and so they very much deserved the award.

The *Robot and Team Image* prize is for the team which present themselves and their robot in the most outstanding and stylish manner. This year the prize went to the team from [Gymnasium Markt Indersdorf][MAI], who came all the way from Germany looking very Frankenstein-esque, wearing their bio-hazard suits and zombie face paints. Their robot was a rotten-fleshy-green colour with a brain exposed.

The *Online Presence* award is given to the team with the best website, social media presence, or combination of the two. This year it was awarded to [Queen Mary's College][QMC] for their entertaining regular updates on their blog and their relentless interaction on twitter.

Student Robotics 2017 promises to be bigger than ever! If you'd like to compete, see [the How to Enter page](/schools/how_to_enter) for more information. Start talking to your teachers and recruiting team members as soon as possible!

Notes to editors
----------------

Student Robotics is an annual robotics competition for 16-18 year-olds in the UK and Europe. It was founded in 2006 by university students and is free to enter thanks to [our sponsors][sponsors] and [many volunteers][volunteers]. Since it was first run in 2008, the final competition has grown from one room at the University of Southampton[^1] to a two-day event for more than 50 teams and over 400 students.

[^1]: Student Robotics is independent from the University of Southampton.

At the start of the academic year, teams are given a kit containing custom-made electronics at a Kickstart event, where the game for the year is announced. They then have until the end of the Easter holiday to build fully-autonomous robots which will compete against each other in the final competition. They are supported by volunteer mentors, and software to assist them in programming their robots is provided.

High resolution photographs of the event will be uploaded to [the Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/sr2016). If you would like to find out more, please [get in touch](/about/contactus).
