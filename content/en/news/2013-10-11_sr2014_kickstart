It's that time of year again. The Student Robotics Competition Kickstart!
=========================================================================


Thanks to a record fifty-four teams of sixth form students from across Europe competing in this year's competition,
 and the ever relentless work of the Blueshirts, this year's Kickstart was bigger and better than ever before.
On Saturday 12th October teams gathered in the Universities of Bristol and Southampton
 along with Gresham's School in north Norfolk for a day of hacking, with Munich soon to follow.

This year Kickstart has been overhauled in order to improve the quality of service that we can deliver to teams.
The initial talks included a video introduction to the core concepts and kit,
 followed by Blueshirts at each location explaining the game to the teams and taking questions from students eager to probe for loopholes.

The rest of the day was spent hacking away at various tasks,
 to educate & familiarise students with the kit, the IDE,
 and the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language.
This way, every team, experienced or not, can get some hands on,
 Blueshirt assisted training, which helps to level the playing field between rookie and veteran teams.

This year's game, Slots, challenges teams to collect 200mm boxes from the arena,
 rotate them and place them into central zones, with bonuses for placing them in the eponymous slots.
Five ways to score, four robots, three minutes.
Full details are available in the [rules](/docs/rules).

After the initial talks, teams were tasked with the "Micro games"
 designed to guide teams through all the complex aspects of building a robot.
From humble beginnings of blinking an LED, to assembling the kit in all its glory,
 all the way through to charging batteries and recognising tokens.
Teams worked at their own pace, supported as ever by enthusiastic Blueshirts,
 and left ready to go forth and build.

In the next couple of weeks we will be providing all students and teachers
 with their very own [user accounts](/docs/user_accounts), activating the [forums](/forum),
 and sending out mentors, but until then, get busy hacking!

And don't forget to comment your code.

AND don't forget to **read the [docs](/docs/)**.
