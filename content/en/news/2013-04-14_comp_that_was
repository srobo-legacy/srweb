That was the Competition that was
=================================

Student Robotics is over for another year! After almost six months of work by thirty-two teams came a final weekend of frantic building, coding and pizza consumption. Oh, and the small matter of a 114-match league tournament topped with a knockout competition to decide the winner.

The challenge this year was to build a robot capable of playing A Strange Game. To score points, a robot had to claim squares in a 3x3 grid by placing more tokens in them than its opponents, or by lifting one of its tokens onto a pedestal to permanently claim that square.

[Description of robots entered (grabber types, how many used pedestals, any other interesting or extraordinary things)]

We were very impressed by the quality of the teams' robots this year. Congratulations to everyone who took part. We hope you've had fun!

If you didn't take part but your appetite's been whetted, or you want to enter again next year, the sign up page for next year's competition will be up in a couple of weeks. Get forming your teams and talking to teachers now!
