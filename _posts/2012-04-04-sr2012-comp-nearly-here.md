There is just over a week to go before the SR2012 Competition!

Just over six months ago, this year's Student Robotics competitors were tasked with building fully autonomous robots to play this year's game, "Pirate Plunder".  In this game, robots race to collect cube-shaped tokens scattered randomly in the middle of the arena.  Depositing these tokens into the bucket that each team has at the start of the match brings more points.  However, 
teams can steal each other's buckets, which means teams will need to make some interesting strategical decisions.

The competition will be taking place in [Building 40](http://data.southampton.ac.uk/building/40.html),
 Highfield Campus, University of Southampton and is a two day event
 starting on Saturday 14th April at 9:30 AM.
In a change to previous years,
 matches will start towards the end of the first day,
 so be sure that you don't miss out!
There will of course be time to work on your robot on the Saturday morning.

In addition, all team members must bring along their [ticket](/schools/team-leaders/#Tickets),
 obtainable once a Media Consent Form
 has been received by Student Robotics.
More details can be found on the [SR2012 Competition Page](/events/sr2012/2012-04-14-competition).

We look forward to seeing you all there, good luck with the competition
 and may the best robot win!
