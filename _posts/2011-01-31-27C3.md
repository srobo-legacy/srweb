In the talk, Rob discusses the motivation behind SR, what SR is currently doing and is planning to do, and gives a technical overview of the hardware and software we provide.

A [video of the talk](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2010/27c3-4175-en-from_robot_to_robot.html) is available directly from the CCC website, and Rob has made [his slides](http://xgoat.com/wp/wp-content/2010/12/robot-to-robot.pdf) available in PDF form on his blog.
