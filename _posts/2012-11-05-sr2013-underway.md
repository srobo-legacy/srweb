title: SR2013 is now underway
---
The [KickStart](/events/kickstart) event for this year has happened,
the [rules](/docs/rules/) have been declared
and the competition is underway. A number of teams have already started
building their robots and the competition this year is sure to be fierce.
With a whole host of new teams, as well as veterans that have been competing
since the beginning, we (the Blueshirts) are looking forward to seeing some
amazing robotic creations from the competitors.

If you've got a blog/youtube video/anything else awesome you'd like to share
with us feel free to email [info@studentrobotics.org](mailto:info@studentrobotics.org)
or tweet us [@StudentRobotics](https://twitter.com/StudentRobotics).

The forums and the IDE will be available shortly.
