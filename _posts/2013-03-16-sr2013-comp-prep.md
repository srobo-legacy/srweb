title: 36 Teams to compete at SR2013
---
In just under a month, thirty-six robots and
three hundred young people will converge on
the University of Southampton for the largest Student Robotics Competition to
date.

In November 2012, a lecture theatre packed with sixth formers started designing
robots to take part in ["A Strange
Game"](/schools/game).  In this game, Robots must move
large cubes onto pedestals to form lines of tokens in a big game of
noughts-and-crosses, while stopping their rivals from scoring too. And
to make it more interesting, their robots must operate completely
autonomously, only taking commands from a Python program on board the robot.

Since then, the teams have spent four months prototyping and testing
their robots. Some really exciting designs have been developed, including
[scissor lifts](http://youtu.be/LE0VB2YFbDk),
[vacuum suckers](http://youtu.be/kZ7iUeqvsAA),
and even a [hovercraft!](http://youtu.be/dRvJU7jqncM)

This year [the competition](/events/sr2013/2013-04-13-competition) will be taking place
at the [Students Union](http://data.southampton.ac.uk/building/42.html)
building at the University of Southampton, over the 13th and 14th of April.
Please note that competitors must bring their
[ticket](/schools/team-leaders/#Tickets) with them.
Families, friends and all members of the public are welcome to
attend too, with persons under the age of 18 accompanied by an adult.

We look forward to seeing you there, and may the best robot win!
