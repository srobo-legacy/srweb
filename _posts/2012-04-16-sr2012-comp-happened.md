Student Robotics 2012 is over!
After much hard work, hacking, and bodging,
 twenty teams from sixteen UK schools across five counties,
 and three countries came together to pit their robotic creations in a mammoth battle of wits.

Each team had to build a robot that could collect tokens & buckets to score points.
Further points could be scored by placing the tokens into the robots' zones,
 and by placing tokens into the collected buckets.
The robots used a number of sensing mechanisms,
 from the provided vision system
 to various implementations of distance sensors.

The two days comprised a gruelling 46 match league stage provided seeding for the later knock-out stage that would determine the winners of Student Robotics 2012.
Congratulations to all the competitors, whatever place achieved,
 we hope that you've all had fun & learnt something along the way.
