The annual Student Robotics competition KickStart happened today, and we think everyone had a great day!
Everyone was certainly kept very busy!

The [rulebook](/docs/rules/) is now live.
Make sure you give it a good read if you're taking part.
For those of you that have taken part before, please note that some of the regulations have changed &mdash; don't let them catch you out!

A big thanks to all of you that came,

See you all again soon,

_The SR Team_
