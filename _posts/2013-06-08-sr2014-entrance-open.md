title: Entrance to SR2014 now open
---
Today we opened up registration for the current iteration of our competition, SR2014.
The rules for the game the robots will play will be announced at our kickstart event at the beginning of October.
Teams will then have just over six months to construct their robots before the competition in April 2014.

If you have a team of 16-18 year-olds that you would like to enter for the competition,
 please fill out [this interest form](/schools/how_to_enter) and we will get in touch with you as soon as we can.
Thanks to our [sponsors](/about/sponsors), we can accept even more teams for this year's competition.
