			<h1>What is Student Robotics?</h1>
			<p>
				Student Robotics is an annual robotics competition that challenges teams of 16-18 year-olds to design, build and present their own fully autonomous robots.
				It is free to take part and we exist to enthuse, excite and encourage a real-world approach to engineering.

			<h1>Get Involved</h1>
			<p>
				Not only are we always looking to recruit more teams, we are continuously striving to expand our ever growing group of industry and university mentors.
				Mentors play a key role in a team's development and learning.
				As a mentor you would help guide a team through their robot building journey, from Kickstart to Competition.
