Installation Instructions for SRweb
==================================

Simple Installation
-------------------

There are a number of scripts in the `script` directory which follow the [Scripts to Rule Them All](http://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all/) convention.

For example, to get up and running with a basic `srweb` instance, you simply need to run:

	./script/setup
	./script/server

If you have not worked on `srweb` for sometime and think there might have been some changes you can run:

	./script/update
	./script/server

Once the server is running you can access it by going to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Note that these scripts do not perfectly replicate the production environment however they are suitable for use for development.

Legacy Instructions
-------------------

SRweb is a website, and as such you'll need a working webserver to run it.
This guide generally expects you've got [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/)
available, and that you know roughly how to configure it.
To help with this, there's an Apache install guide here:
https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/wiki/ApacheInstallGuide

* Grab submodules:

	+ git submodule update --init

* Install php-Smarty:

	+ for yum: `sudo yum install php-Smarty`
	+ for apt: `sudo apt-get install smarty3`
	+ (for both, ensure config.inc.php is set correctly)

* ensure 'templates_compiled' and 'cache' is owned by apache user.
  There are a number of ways you can do this:

	+ `chown $APACHEU:$APACHEG templates_compiled/ cache/` (where
	  $APACHEU and $APACHEG are the Apache user and Apache group,
	  respectively)
	+ `setfacl -m u:$APACHEU:rwx templates_compiled/ cache/` to
	  allow r/w/x access to the apache user as well as the owner.
	  The `install.sh` script provided can perform this option for you.
	+ You could also chmod, but depending on the dir's location, that
          may not be the best way.

* ensure that mod_expires and mod_rewrite are installed and loaded in the
  main Apache configuration file.
  These are usually installed by default but not loaded. You can load them
  using `sudo a2enmod rewrite expires`. You'll need to restart apache after
  doing so, `sudo apachectl restart` will do this.

* If deploying to a URL other than the root (for example if using a per-user
  public_html, you might have <http://localhost/~dave/srweb>) you'll need
  to modify the .htaccess file to use the correct 'RewriteBase'.

* You will probably also need to enable use of overrides in the .htaccess
  file. This can be done by ensuring that Apache is told `AllowOverride All`
  for the directory which contains the checkout. This means adding something
  like:
    ```<Directory /var/www/html/>
           AllowOverride All
       </Directory>```
  to one of its config files.
  On Ubuntu this can be done by adding those contents to a new 'httpd.conf'
  file in /etc/apache2/conf-available/ and then running `sudo a2enconf httpd`
  and reloading the apache configuration `sudo apachectl reload`.


That should be it! Hope that helped.
